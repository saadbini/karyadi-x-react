# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### For installing the repo in VS Code (locally)

For the front-end: (Execute the following commands)
- npm install
- npm run dev 

For the back-end (Execute the following commands)

Method (1)
- cd server 
- npm run start 

Method (2)
- cd server 
- npm install -g nodemon 
- npm run dev

The front-end & back-end should be ran in different terminals at the same time

When ran locally, the url of the api should be changed to the localhost using port 5000
